Use when conducting literature review, searching for related work, finding baseline papers, or looking for methodology references.\n---\n\n# Paper Finder\n\nSystematic paper discovery and prioritization for research projects.\n\n## When to Use\n\n- Starting a literature review\n- Looking for related work on a topic\n- Finding baseline papers for experiments\n- Searching for methodology references\n- Building a citation list for a research paper\n\n## How to Use\n\nRun the helper script from your workspace:\n\n```bash\npython .claude/skills/paper-finder/scripts/find_papers.py \"your research topic\"\n```\n\nOptions:\n- `--mode fast` (default): Quick search\n- `--mode diligent`: Thorough search (recommended for comprehensive review)\n- `--format json`: Output as JSON instead of text\n\nExample:\n```bash\npython .claude/skills/paper-finder/scripts/find_papers.py \"hypothesis generation with large language models\" --mode fast\n```\n\n## Search Strategy\n\n### Query Formulation\n\nUse structured queries for better results:\n\n1. **Core concept + Method**: \"transformer attention mechanism\"\n2. **Problem + Domain**: \"few-shot learning natural language processing\"\n3. **Technique + Application**: \"graph neural networks drug discovery\"\n\n### Multi-Stage Search\n\n1. **Broad scan**: Start with general topic terms\n2. **Focused dive**: Use specific method/technique names from initial results\n3. **Citation chase**: Search for highly-cited papers referenced in relevant work\n\n## Citation Prioritization\n\n### Relevance Tiers\n\n| Relevance Score | Priority | Action |\n|-----------------|----------|--------|\n| 3 (High) | Must read | Download PDF, read fully, cite |\n| 2 (Medium) | Should read | Read abstract + intro, cite if relevant |\n| 1 (Low) | Optional | Skim abstract, cite only if needed |\n| 0 (Not relevant) | Skip | Do not include |\n\n### Citation Count Thresholds\n\n| Category | Citation Count | Interpretation |\n|----------|----------------|----------------|\n| Seminal | 1000+ | Foundational work, must cite |\n| Well-established | 100-999 | Widely accepted, cite if relevant |\n| Recent/Emerging | 10-99 | Current research, cite for novelty |\n| New | <10 | Very recent, check publication venue |\n\n### Venue Tiers (ML/AI Focus)\n\n**Tier 1** (Top venues, high credibility):\n- NeurIPS, ICML, ICLR, ACL, EMNLP, CVPR, ICCV\n\n**Tier 2** (Strong venues):\n- AAAI, IJCAI, NAACL, COLING, ECCV, WACV\n\n**Tier 3** (Good venues):\n- *ACL workshops, COLM, EACL, CoNLL\n\n**Preprints** (arXiv):\n- Check for peer-reviewed version first\n- Cite arXiv only if no published version exists\n\n## Screening Workflow\n\n### Phase 1: Title Screening\n- Review titles from search results\n- Mark papers as \"include\", \"exclude\", or \"maybe\"\n- Goal: ~50% reduction\n\n### Phase 2: Abstract Screening\n- Read abstracts for included/maybe papers\n- Evaluate: relevance, methodology, findings\n- Goal: Identify key papers for deeper reading\n\n### Phase 3: Full-Text Review\n- Download and read full PDFs for key papers\n- Extract: methods, results, limitations, citations\n- Use the PDF chunker for detailed reading (see below)\n\n## Output Structure\n\nReturns relevance-ranked papers with:\n- Title, authors, year\n- Abstract (already extracted)\n- URL for download\n- Relevance score (0-3, focus on papers with score >= 2)\n- Citation count\n\n## After Finding Papers\n\n1. Download PDFs for papers with relevance >= 2\n2. Read abstracts first (already provided in output)\n3. Only read full PDFs for most relevant papers\n4. Write notes to literature_review.md immediately\n5. Track citations for references.bib\n\n## Reading Large PDFs\n\nUse the PDF chunker to split papers into smaller PDF files that can be read directly.\nThis preserves all formatting perfectly (unlike text extraction which loses formatting).\n\n**Dependencies:**\n```bash\n# Using uv (recommended):\nuv add pypdf\n\n# Or with pip:\npip install pypdf\n```\n\n**How to run:**\n\n```bash\npython .claude/skills/paper-finder/scripts/pdf_chunker.py <pdf_path>\n```\n\nOptions:\n- `--pages-per-chunk N`: Number of pages per chunk (default: 1)\n- `--output-dir DIR`: Output directory (default: `<pdf_dir>/pages`)\n\n**Output:**\n- Creates PDF chunk files: `<pdf_name>_chunk_001.pdf`, `<pdf_name>_chunk_002.pdf`, etc.\n- Creates a manifest: `<pdf_name>_manifest.txt` listing all chunks with page ranges\n\n**Integration with screening workflow:**\n1. Run the chunker on papers before detailed reading\n2. For abstract skimming: read only chunk 1 (page 1 or pages 1-3)\n3. For deep reading: read ALL chunk PDFs sequentially, writing notes after each\n4. Check the manifest to see how many chunks exist\n5. IMPORTANT: Do not skip chunks - methodology and results are in later chunks\n\n## If Paper-Finder Service Not Running\n\nThe script will show a fallback message. Use manual search instead:\n- arXiv: https://arxiv.org\n- Semantic Scholar: https://www.semanticscholar.org\n- Papers with Code: https://paperswithcode.com\n- Google Scholar: https://scholar.google.com\n\nManual search works well - paper-finder is just a convenience for faster, more targeted results.\n\n## References\n\nSee `references/` folder for:\n- `search_strategies.md`: Detailed search query formulation\n- `prioritization_guide.md`: Extended prioritization criteria\n","exit_code":0,"status":"completed"}}

We ﬁrst develop a causal intervention\nfor identifying neuron activations that are decisive in a model’s factual predictions.\nThis reveals a distinct set of steps in middle-layer feed-forward modules that me-\ndiate factual predictions while processing subject tokens. To test our hypothesis\nthat these computations correspond to factual association recall, we modify feed-\nforward weights to update speciﬁc factual associations using Rank-One Model\nEditing (ROME). We ﬁnd that ROME is effective on a standard zero-shot relation\nextraction (zsRE) model-editing task. We also evaluate ROME on a new dataset\nof difﬁcult counterfactual assertions, on which it simultaneously maintains both\nspeciﬁcity and generalization, whereas other methods sacriﬁce one or another. Our\nresults conﬁrm an important role for mid-layer feed-forward modules in storing fac-\ntual associations and suggest that direct manipulation of computational mechanisms\nmay be a feasible approach for model editing. The code, dataset, visualizations, and\nan interactive demo notebook are available at https://rome.baulab.info/.\n1 Introduction\nWhere does a large language model store its facts? In this paper, we report evidence that factual\nassociations in GPT correspond to a localized computation that can be directly edited.\nLarge language models can predict factual statements about the world (Petroni et al., 2019; Jiang\net al., 2020; Roberts et al., 2020). For example, given the preﬁx “The Space Needle is located in the\ncity of,” GPT will reliably predict the true answer: “ Seattle” (Figure 1a). Factual knowledge has been\nobserved to emerge in both autoregressive GPT models (Radford et al., 2019; Brown et al., 2020) and\nmasked BERT models (Devlin et al., 2019).\nIn this paper, we investigate how such factual associations are stored within GPT-like autoregressive\ntransformer models. Although many of the largest neural networks in use today are autoregressive,\nthe way that they store knowledge remains under-explored. Some research has been done for masked\nmodels (Petroni et al., 2019; Jiang et al., 2020; Elazar et al., 2021a; Geva et al., 2021; Dai et al.,\n2022; De Cao et al., 2021), but GPT has architectural differences such as unidirectional attention and\ngeneration capabilities that provide an opportunity for new insights.\nWe use two approaches. First, we trace the causal effects of hidden stateactivations within GPT using\ncausal mediation analysis (Pearl, 2001; Vig et al., 2020b) to identify the speciﬁc modules that mediate\nrecall of a fact about a subject (Figure 1). Our analysis reveals that feedforward MLPs at a range of\nmiddle layers are decisive when processing the last token of the subject name (Figures 1b,2b,3).\nSecond, we test this ﬁnding in model weights by introducing a Rank-One Model Editing method\n(ROME) to alter the parameters that determine a feedfoward layer’s behavior at the decisive token.\n∗Equal contribution.

(d) Some sets of activations cause the output to return to the original prediction; the light\nblue path shows an example of information ﬂow. The causal impact on output probability is mapped for the\neffect of (e) each hidden state on the prediction, (f) only MLP activations, and (g) only attention activations.\nDespite the simplicity of the intervention, we ﬁnd that ROME is similarly effective to other model-\nediting approaches on a standard zero-shot relation extraction benchmark (Section 3.2).\nTo evaluate ROME’s impact on more difﬁcult cases, we introduce a dataset of counterfactual assertions\n(Section 3.3) that would not have been observed in pretraining. Our evaluations (Section 3.4) conﬁrm\nthat midlayer MLP modules can store factual associations that generalize beyond speciﬁc surface\nforms, while remaining speciﬁc to the subject. Compared to previous ﬁne-tuning (Zhu et al., 2020),\ninterpretability-based (Dai et al., 2022), and meta-learning (Mitchell et al., 2021; De Cao et al., 2021)\nmethods, ROME achieves good generalization and speciﬁcity simultaneously, whereas previous\napproaches sacriﬁce one or the other.\n2 Interventions on Activations for Tracing Information Flow\nTo locate facts within the parameters of a large pretrained autoregressive transformer, we begin by\nanalyzing and identifying the speciﬁc hidden states that have the strongest causal effect on predictions\nof individual facts. We represent each fact as a knowledge tuplet = (s,r,o ) containing the subject\ns, objecto, and relationr connecting the two. Then to elicit the fact in GPT, we provide a natural\nlanguage promptp describing (s,r ) and examine the model’s prediction ofo.\nAn autoregressive transformer language modelG :X→Y over vocabularyV maps a token sequence\nx = [x1,...,x T ]∈X ,xi∈ V to a probability distribution y∈Y⊂ R|V| that predicts next-token\ncontinuations of x. Within the transformer, the ith token is embedded as a series of hidden state\nvectorsh(l)\ni , beginning withh(0)\ni = emb(xi) + pos(i)∈ RH. The ﬁnal outputy = decode(h(L)\nT ) is\nread from the last hidden state.\nWe visualize the internal computation ofG as a grid (Figure 1a) of hidden statesh(l)\ni in which each\nlayerl (left→ right) adds global attention a(l)\ni and local MLP m(l)\ni contributions computed from\nprevious layers, and where each tokeni (top→ bottom) attends to previous states from other tokens.\nRecall that, in the autoregressive case, tokens only draw information from past (above) tokens:\nh(l)\ni =h(l−1)\ni +a(l)\ni +m(l)\ni\na(l)\ni = attn(l)\n(\nh(l−1)\n1 ,h (l−1)\n2 ,...,h (l−1)\ni\n)\n(1)\nm(l)\ni =W (l)\nprojσ\n(\nW (l)\nf cγ\n(\na(l)\ni +h(l−1)\ni\n))\n.\n2\nearly site\nDetail in\nFigure 3\nlate site\nearly site\nlate site\n(a) (b) (c)\nFigure 2: Average Indirect Effectof individual model components over a sample of 1000 factual statements\nreveals two important sites. (a) Strong causality at a ‘late site’ in the last layers at the last token is unsurprising,\nbut strongly causal states at an ‘early site’ in middle layers at the last subject token is a new discovery. (b) MLP\ncontributions dominate the early site. (c) Attention is important at the late site. Appendix B, Figure 7 shows\nthese heatmaps as line plots with 95% conﬁdence intervals.\nEach layer’s MLP is a two-layer neural network parameterized by matricesW (l)\nproj andW (l)\nf c , with\nrectifying nonlinearityσ and normalizing nonlinearityγ. For further background on transformers,\nwe refer to Vaswani et al. (2017).3\n2.1 Causal Tracing of Factual Associations\nThe grid of states (Figure 1) forms a causal graph (Pearl, 2009) describing dependencies between the\nhidden variables. This graph contains many paths from inputs on the left to the output (next-word\nprediction) at the lower-right, and we wish to understand if there are speciﬁc hidden state variables\nthat are more important than others when recalling a fact.\nAs Vig et al. (2020b) have shown, this is a natural case forcausal mediation analysis, which quantiﬁes\nthe contribution of intermediate variables in causal graphs (Pearl, 2001). To calculate each state’s\ncontribution towards a correct factual prediction, we observe all ofG’s internal activations during\nthree runs: a clean run that predicts the fact, a corrupted run where the prediction is damaged, and a\ncorrupted-with-restoration run that tests the ability of a single state to restore the prediction.\n• In the clean run , we pass a factual prompt x into G and collect all hidden activations\n{h(l)\ni |i∈ [1,T ],l∈ [1,L ]}. Figure 1a provides an example illustration with the prompt: “The\nSpace Needle is in downtown ”, for which the expected completion iso = “Seattle”.\n• In the baseline corrupted run, the subject is obfuscated from G before the network runs. Con-\ncretely, immediately afterx is embedded as [h(0)\n1 ,h (0)\n2 ,...,h (0)\nT ], we seth(0)\ni :=h(0)\ni +ϵ for all\nindicesi that correspond to the subject entity, whereϵ∼N (0;ν)4; .G is then allowed to continue\nnormally, giving us a set of corrupted activations{h(l)\ni∗ |i∈ [1,T ],l∈ [1,L ]}. Because G loses\nsome information about the subject, it will likely return an incorrect answer (Figure 1b).\n• The corrupted-with-restoration run, letsG run computations on the noisy embeddings as in the\ncorrupted baseline, except at some token ˆi and layer ˆl. There, we hook G so that it is forced to\n","exit_code":0,"status":"completed"}}

Our code and data are at memit.baulab.info.\n1 I NTRODUCTION\nHow many memories can we add to a deep network by directly editing its weights?\nAlthough large autoregressive language models (Radford et al., 2019; Brown et al., 2020; Wang &\nKomatsuzaki, 2021; Black et al., 2022) are capable of recalling an impressive array of common facts\nsuch as “Tim Cook is the CEO of Apple” or “Polaris is in the constellation Ursa Minor” (Petroni et al.,\n2020; Brown et al., 2020), even very large models are known to lack more specialized knowledge,\nand they may recall obsolete information if not updated periodically (Lazaridou et al., 2021; Agarwal\n& Nenkova, 2022; Liska et al., 2022). The ability to maintain fresh and customizable information is\ndesirable in many application domains, such as question answering, knowledge search, and content\ngeneration. For example, we might want to keep search models updated with breaking news and\nrecently-generated user feedback. In other situations, authors or companies may wish to customize\nmodels with specific knowledge about their creative work or products. Because re-training a large\nmodel can be prohibitive (Patterson et al., 2021) we seek methods that can update knowledge directly.\nTo that end, several knowledge-editing methods have been proposed to insert new memories directly\ninto specific model parameters. The approaches include constrained fine-tuning (Zhu et al., 2020),\nhypernetwork knowledge editing (De Cao et al., 2021; Hase et al., 2021; Mitchell et al., 2021; 2022),\nand rank-one model editing (Meng et al., 2022). However, this body of work is typically limited to\nupdating at most a few dozen facts; a recent study evaluates on a maximum of 75 (Mitchell et al.,\n2022) whereas others primarily focus on single-edit cases.

Inspired by the ROME direct editing method (Meng et al., 2022),\nMEMIT targets the weights of transformer modules that we determine to be causal mediators of\nfactual knowledge recall. Experiments on GPT-J (6B parameters; Wang & Komatsuzaki 2021)\nand GPT-NeoX (20B; Black et al. 2022) demonstrate that MEMIT can scale and successfully\nstore thousands of memories in bulk . We analyze model behavior when inserting true facts,\ncounterfactuals, 27 specific relations, and different mixed sets of memories. In each setting, we\nmeasure robustness in terms of generalization, specificity, and fluency while comparing the scaling of\nMEMIT to rank-one, hypernetwork, and fine-tuning baselines.\n2 R ELATED WORK\nScalable knowledge bases. The representation of world knowledge is a core problem in artificial\nintelligence (Richens, 1956; Minsky, 1974), classically tackled by constructing knowledge bases of\nreal-world concepts. Pioneering hand-curated efforts (Lenat, 1995; Miller, 1995) have been followed\nby web-powered knowledge graphs (Auer et al., 2007; Bollacker et al., 2007; Suchanek et al., 2007;\nHavasi et al., 2007; Carlson et al., 2010; Dong et al., 2014; Vrandeˇci´c & Krötzsch, 2014; Bosselut\net al., 2019) that extract knowledge from large-scale sources. Structured knowledge bases can be\nprecisely queried, measured, and updated (Davis et al., 1993), but they are limited by sparse coverage\nof uncatalogued knowledge, such as commonsense facts (Weikum, 2021).\nLanguage models as knowledge bases. Since LLMs can answer natural-language queries about\nreal-world facts, it has been proposed that they could be used directly as knowledge bases (Petroni\net al., 2019; Roberts et al., 2020; Jiang et al., 2020; Shin et al., 2020). However, LLM knowledge\nis only implicit; responses are sensitive to specific phrasings of the prompt (Elazar et al., 2021;\nPetroni et al., 2020), and it remains difficult to catalog, add, or update knowledge (AlKhamissi et al.,\n2022). Nevertheless, LLMs are promising because they scale well and are unconstrained by a fixed\nschema (Safavi & Koutra, 2021). In this paper, we take on the update problem, asking how the\nimplicit knowledge encoded within model parameters can be mass-edited.\nHypernetwork knowledge editors. Several meta-learning methods have been proposed to edit\nknowledge in a model. Sinitsin et al. (2019) proposes a training objective to produce models amenable\nto editing by gradient descent. De Cao et al. (2021) proposes a Knowledge Editor (KE) hypernetwork\nthat edits a standard model by predicting updates conditioned on new factual statements. In a study\nof KE, Hase et al. (2021) find that it fails to scale beyond a few edits, and they scale an improved\nobjective to 10 beliefs. MEND (Mitchell et al., 2021) also adopts meta-learning, inferring weight\nupdates from the gradient of the inserted fact. To scale their method, Mitchell et al. (2022) proposes\nSERAC, a system that routes rewritten facts through a different set of parameters while keeping the\noriginal weights unmodified; they demonstrate scaling up to 75 edits. Rather than meta-learning, our\nmethod employs direct parameter updates based on an explicitly computed mapping.\nDirect model editing. Our work most directly builds upon efforts to localize and understand the\ninternal mechanisms within LLMs (Elhage et al., 2021; Dar et al., 2022). Based on observations from\nGeva et al. (2021; 2022) that transformer MLP layers serve as key–value memories, we narrow our\nfocus to them. We then employ causal mediation analysis (Pearl, 2001; Vig et al., 2020; Meng et al.,\n2022), which implicates a specific range of layers in recalling factual knowledge. Previously, Dai\net al. (2022) and Yao et al. (2022) have proposed editing methods that alter sparse sets of neurons, but\nwe adopt the classical view of a linear layer as an associative memory (Anderson, 1972; Kohonen,\n1972). Our method is closely related to Meng et al. (2022), which also updates GPT as an explicit\nassociative memory. Unlike the single-edit approach taken in that work, we modify a sequence of\nlayers and develop a way for thousands of modifications to be performed simultaneously.\n3 P RELIMINARIES : L ANGUAGE MODELING AND MEMORY EDITING\nThe goal of MEMIT is to modify factual associations stored in the parameters of an autoregressive\nLLM.

In this paper, we study facts of the\nform (subject s, relation r, object o), e.g., (s = Michael Jordan, r = plays sport, o = basketball). A\ngenerator G can recall a memory for (si, ri, ∗) if we form a natural language prompt pi = p(si, ri)\nsuch as “Michael Jordan plays the sport of” and predict the next token(s) representing oi. Our goal is\nto edit many memories at once. We formally define a list of edit requests as:\nE = {(si, ri, oi) | i} s.t. ∄i, j. (si = sj) ∧ (ri = rj) ∧ (oi ̸= oj).

At a superficial level, a memory can be considered edited\nafter the model assigns a higher probability to the statement “Michael Jordan plays the sport of\nbaseball” than to the original prediction (basketball); we say that such an update is effective. Yet it is\nimportant to also view the question in terms of generalization, specificity, and fluency:\n• To test for generalization, we can rephrase the question: “What is Michael Jordan’s sport? What\nsport does he play professionally?” If the modification of G is superficial and overfitted to the\nspecific memorized prompt, such predictions will fail to recall the edited memory, “baseball.”\n","exit_code":0,"status":"completed"}}

Manning\nStanford University\neric.mitchell@cs.stanford.edu\nABSTRACT\nWhile large pre-trained models have enabled impressive results on a variety of\ndownstream tasks, the largest existing models still make errors, and even accurate\npredictions may become outdated over time. Because detecting all such failures at\ntraining time is impossible, enabling both developers and end users of such models\nto correct inaccurate outputs while leaving the model otherwise intact is desirable.\nHowever, the distributed, black-box nature of the representations learned by large\nneural networks makes producing such targeted edits difﬁcult. If presented with\nonly a single problematic input and new desired output, ﬁne-tuning approaches\ntend to overﬁt; other editing algorithms are either computationally infeasible or\nsimply ineffective when applied to very large models. To enable easy post-hoc\nediting at scale, we propose Model Editor Networks with Gradient Decomposi-\ntion (MEND), a collection of small auxiliary editing networks that use a single\ndesired input-output pair to make fast, local edits to a pre-trained model’s be-\nhavior. MEND learns to transform the gradient obtained by standard ﬁne-tuning,\nusing a low-rank decomposition of the gradient to make the parameterization of\nthis transformation tractable. MEND can be trained on a single GPU in less than\na day even for 10 billion+ parameter models; once trained MEND enables rapid\napplication of new edits to the pre-trained model. Our experiments with T5, GPT,\nBERT, and BART models show that MEND is the only approach to model editing\nthat effectively edits the behavior of models with more than 10 billion parameters.\nCode and data available at https://sites.google.com/view/mend-editing.\n1 I NTRODUCTION\nIncreasingly large models have improved performance on a variety of modern computer vision\n(Huang et al., 2017; Chen et al., 2022) and especially natural language processing (Vaswani et al.,\n2017; Brown et al., 2020) problems. However, a key challenge in deploying and maintaining such\nmodels is issuing patches to adjust model behavior after deployment (Sinitsin et al., 2020). When\na neural network produces an undesirable output, making a localized update to correct its behavior\nfor a single input or small number of inputs is non-trivial, owing to the distributed nature of the\nmodel’s representations. For example, a large language model trained in 2019 might assign higher\nprobability to Theresa May than to Boris Johnson when prompted with Who is the prime minis-\nter of the UK? (see Table 2 for an example with a real large language model; see Lazaridou et al.\n(2021) for a systematic study of failures of temporal generalization in LMs). An ideal model editing\nFigure 1: The proposed algorithm MEND enables editability by training a collection of MLPs to modify model\ngradients to produce local model edits that do not damage model performance on unrelated inputs. MEND is\nefﬁcient to train and apply edits, even for very large models, as shown in Section 5.1.\n1\narXiv:2110.11309v2  [cs.LG]  13 Jun 2022\nPublished as a conference paper at ICLR 2022\nprocedure could quickly update the model parameters to increase the relative likelihood of Boris\nJohnson without changing the model output for unrelated inputs. This procedure would produce\nedits with reliability, successfully changing the model’s output on the problematic input (e.g., Who\nis the prime minister of the UK? ); locality, minimally affecting the model’s output for unrelated\ninputs (e.g., What sports team does Messi play for? ); and generality, generating the correct output\nfor inputs related to the edit input (e.g., Who is the UK PM?).\nA simple approach to making such edits is additional ﬁne-tuning with a new label on the single ex-\nample to be corrected. Yet ﬁne-tuning on a single example tends to overﬁt, even when constraining\nthe distance between the pre- and post-ﬁne-tuning parameters (Zhu et al., 2020; De Cao et al., 2021).\nThis overﬁtting leads to failures of both locality and generality. While ﬁne-tuning on the edit exam-\nple along with continued training on the training set better enforces locality, our experiments show\nthat it still lacks generality. Further, it requires persistent access to the full training set during test\ntime and is more computationally demanding. As an alternative, recent work has considered meth-\nods that learn to make model edits. Sinitsin et al. (2020) describe a bi-level meta-learning objective\nthat ﬁnds a model initialization for which standard ﬁne-tuning on a single edit example produces\nuseful edits. While effective, the computational requirements of learning such an editable represen-\ntation make scaling to very large models, where fast, effective edits are most needed, difﬁcult (see\nFigure 3). De Cao et al. (2021) describe a computationally efﬁcient learning-based alternative, but\nit fails to edit very large models in our experiments. We thus devise a procedure that yields reliable,\nlocal, and general edits, while easily scaling to models with over 10 billion parameters.\nOur approach trains lightweight model editor networks to produce edits to a pre-trained model’s\nweights when provided with the standard ﬁne-tuning gradient of a given correction as input, lever-\naging the gradient as an information-rich starting point for editing (see Figure 1). Because gradients\nare high-dimensional objects, directly parameterizing a function that maps a gradient into a new\nparameter update is enormously costly. Even for a single d×d weight matrix, a naive implemen-\ntation requires a mapping from RO(d2) → RO(d2), which is impractical for large models where\nd≈ 104. However, by decomposing this gradient into its rank-1 outer product form, our approach is\ninstead able to learn a function g : RO(d)→ RO(d). We call our approach Model Editor Networks\nwith Gradient Decomposition (MEND). MEND parameterizes these gradient mapping functions as\nMLPs with a single hidden layer (Figure 2), using a small number of parameters compared with the\nmodels they edit. MEND can be applied to any pre-trained model, regardless of pre-training.\nThe primary contribution of this work is a scalable algorithm for fast model editing that can edit very\nlarge pre-trained language models by leveraging the low-rank structure of ﬁne-tuning gradients. We\nperform empirical evaluations on a variety of language-related tasks and transformer models, show-\ning that MEND is the only algorithm that can consistently edit the largest GPT-style (Radford et al.,\n2019; Black et al., 2021; Wang and Komatsuzaki, 2021) and T5 (Raffel et al., 2020) language mod-\nels. Finally, our ablation experiments highlight the impact of MEND’s key components, showing\nthat variants of MEND are likely to scale to models with hundreds of billions of parameters.\n2 T HE MODEL EDITING PROBLEM\nThe goal of model editing is to enable the use of a single pair of input xe and desired output ye\nto alter a base model’s output for xe as well as its equivalence neighborhood (related input/output\npairs), all while leaving model behavior on unrelated inputs unchanged (Sinitsin et al., 2020; De\nCao et al., 2021). For a question-answering model, a model editor would use a question and new\ndesired answer to update the model in a way that correctly answers the question and its semantically-\nequivalent rephrasings without affecting model performance on unrelated questions. Some model\neditors, including ours, use a training phase before they can apply edits (Sinitsin et al., 2020; De Cao\net al., 2021), using an edit training datasetDtr\nedit that speciﬁes the types of edits that will be made.\nMore precisely, the base model fθ :X× Θ→Y is a differentiable function that maps an input x\nand set of parametersθ to an outputy. A model editor is a functionE :X×Y×L× Θ× Φ→ Θ\nthat maps an edit input xe, edit label ye (a class label or sequence of tokens), loss function le :\nX×Y× Θ → R, base model parameters θ, and optional editor parameters φ to a new set of\nmodel parameters θe. We use the loss function le(x,y,θ ) = − logpθ(y|x), based on past work\n(De Cao et al., 2021), but other choices are possible. Model editors are evaluated on a held-out\ndataset Dte\nedit = {(xe,y e,x loc,x′\ne,y′\ne)i}. For algorithms that learn model editor parameters φ, a\ndatasetDtr\nedit containing tuples similar toDte\nedit is used, typically much smaller than the pre-trained\n2\nPublished as a conference paper at ICLR 2022\nFigure 2: The MEND architecture, consisting of two consecutive blocks, both initialized to compute the exact\nidentity function.

A MEND network produces a new rank-1 update ˜∇Wℓ, which is added to weightsWℓ to edit the model.\nmodel’s original training set. The locality inputxloc is simply a randomly sampled input that is used\nto quantify the extent to which model predictions change for unrelated inputs. The alternative edit\ninput and label x′\ne andy′\ne are sampled from the equivalence neighborhood N(xe,y e) ofxe andye,\nthe set of examples that the edited model should generalize to after performing an edit with xe,y e.\nForxe,y e = Who is the prime minister of the UK? Boris Johnson ,N(xe,y e) might containx′\ne,y′\ne =\nWho is the UK PM? Boris Johnson, among others.xloc might be What team does Messi play for?.\nIn this work, we call a model editor reliable if the post-edit model predicts the edit label ye for\nthe edit input xe. We call a model editor local if the disagreement between the pre- and post- edit\nmodels on unrelated samples, i.e., Exloc∼Dte\nedit\nKL(pθ(·|xloc)∥pθe(·|xloc)), is small.1 Finally, we say\na model editor generalizes if the post-edit model predicts the label y′\ne when conditioned on x′\ne, for\n(x′\ne,y′\ne)∈ N(xe,y e). We call a model editor efﬁcient if the time and memory requirements for\ncomputingφ and evaluatingE are small. We deﬁneedit success (ES) to summarize both reliability\nand generality. It is measured as the average accuracy of the edited model pθe on the edit input as\nwell as inputs drawn uniformly from the equivalence neighborhood:\nES = Ex′e,y′e∼N (xe,ye)∪{(xe,ye)}1{argmaxypθe(y|x′\ne) =y′\ne}. (1)\n3 M ODEL EDITOR NETWORKS WITH GRADIENT DECOMPOSITION\nBroadly, MEND is a method for learning to transform the raw ﬁne-tuning gradient into a more\ntargeted parameter update that successfully edits a model in a single step. MEND uses fθ and an\nedit training set Dtr\nedit to produce a collection of model editor networks gℓ, which edit the model’s\nweights given new edit pairs (xe,y e) at test time. Each gℓ transforms the ﬁne-tuning gradient for a\nparticular layerℓ into a parameter update for the layer that provides the reliability, locality, general-\nity, and efﬁciency properties described earlier. Because gradients are high-dimensional objects, the\ninput and output spaces of these networks are also high-dimensional, and parameterizing them in a\ncomputationally feasible manner is challenging. In this section, we describe how MEND does so,\nstarting with a low-rank factorization of fully-connected layer gradients.\n3.1 A PARAMETER -EFFICIENT TRANSFORMATION OF HIGH -DIMENSIONAL GRADIENTS\nThe input to a MEND networkgℓ is the ﬁne-tuning gradient∇Wℓle(xe,y e,θ ) at layerℓ and the output\nis the layer’s parameter edit, which we call ˜∇Wℓ. As noted earlier, for a d×d weight matrix, this\nfunction hasd2 inputs and outputs. Even ifgℓ is a linear network with no hidden layers and produces\nonly a rank-1 parameter edit (motivated by the effectiveness of low-rank model edits observed by\nHu et al. (2021)), this function would still require d2(d +d) = 2 d3 parameters. For a low-rank\nlinear parameterization of gℓ with rank r, we have r(d2 + 2d) parameters, which still carries an\nunacceptable cost for non-trivialr, considering thatd≈ 104 for some models (Raffel et al., 2020).\nMEND solves this problem using the fact that the input to gℓ, the ﬁne-tuning gradient, is a rank-1\nmatrix: the gradient of loss L with respect to weights Wℓ in layer ℓ of an MLP is a rank-1 matrix\nfor each of B batch elements∇WℓL = ∑B\ni=1δi\nℓ+1ui⊤\nℓ , where δi\nℓ+1 is the gradient of the loss for\nbatch element i with respect to the preactivations at layer ℓ + 1, and ui\nℓ are the inputs to layer ℓ\n1See Appendix C.2 for additional details on estimating this KL-divergence.\n3","exit_code":0,"status":"completed"}}

Despite the profi-\nciency in training LLMs, the strategies for ensuring\ntheir relevance and fixing their bugs remain unclear.\nIdeally, as the world’s state evolves, we aim to\nupdate LLMs in a way that sidesteps the computa-\ntional burden associated with training a wholly new\nmodel. As shown in Figure 1, to address this issue,\nthe concept of model editing has been proposed\n∗Equal contribution.\n†Corresponding author.\n1Code and datasets are available athttps://github.com/\nzjunlp/EasyEdit.\nLLMs\nWho is the president of the US?xe:\nJoe Biden\nDonald Trump\nJoe Biden\nDonald Trump\nLLMs\n; ye:Joe Biden\nxe xe\nModel Editing\nfθe\nfθ\nFigure 1: Model editing to fix and update LLMs.\n(Sinitsin et al., 2020; De Cao et al., 2021), enabling\ndata-efficient alterations to the behavior of models,\nspecifically within a designated realm of interest,\nwhile ensuring no adverse impact on other inputs.\nCurrently, numerous works on model editing for\nLLMs (De Cao et al., 2021; Meng et al., 2022,\n2023; Sinitsin et al., 2020; Huang et al., 2023) have\nmade strides in various editing tasks and settings.\nAs illustrated in Figure 2, these works manipulate\nthe model’s output for specific cases by either in-\ntegrating an auxiliary network with the original\nunchanged model or altering the model parameters\nresponsible for the undesirable output. Despite the\nwide range of model editing techniques present in\nthe literature, a comprehensive comparative anal-\nysis, assessing these methods in uniform experi-\nmental conditions, is notably lacking.

How-\never, a primary limitation lies in the significant computational demands during\ntraining, arising from their extensive parameterization. This challenge is further\nintensified by the dynamic nature of the world, necessitating frequent updates\nto LLMs to correct outdated information or integrate new knowledge, thereby\nensuring their continued relevance. Note that many applications demand con-\ntinual model adjustments post-training to address deficiencies or undesirable be-\nhaviors. There is an increasing interest in efficient, lightweight methods for on-\nthe-fly model modifications. To this end, recent years have seen a burgeoning in\nthe techniques of knowledge editing for LLMs, which aim to efficiently modify\nLLMs’ behaviors within specific domains while preserving overall performance\nacross various inputs. In this paper, we first define the knowledge editing problem\nand then provide a comprehensive review of cutting-edge approaches. Drawing\ninspiration from educational and cognitive research theories [1–3], we propose\na unified categorization criterion that classifies knowledge editing methods into\nthree groups: resorting to external knowledge, merging knowledge into the model,\nand editing intrinsic knowledge . Furthermore, we introduce a new benchmark,\nKnowEdit, for a comprehensive empirical evaluation of representative knowledge\nediting approaches. Additionally, we provide an in-depth analysis of knowledge\nlocation, which can give a deeper understanding of the knowledge structures in-\nherent within LLMs. Initially conceived as a means to steer LLMs efficiently,\nwe hope that insights gained from knowledge editing research could shed light\non the underlying knowledge mechanisms of LLMs. To facilitate future research,\nwe have released an open-source framework, EasyEdit1, which will enable practi-\ntioners to efficiently and flexibly implement knowledge editing for LLMs. Finally,\nwe discuss several potential applications of knowledge editing, outlining its broad\nand impactful implications.\nKeywords— natural language processing, large language models, knowledge editing\n∗Equal Contribution.\n†Corresponding Author.\n1https://github.com/zjunlp/EasyEdit.\nThe contributions of the authors are detailed in §CONTRIBUTIONS .\nOngoing work (v5): update Table 4 and add new references.\narXiv:2401.01286v5  [cs.CL]  17 Nov 2024","exit_code":0,"status":"completed"}}

To get started, simply install `conda` and run:\n```bash\n./scripts/setup_conda.sh\n```\n\n## Causal Tracing\n\n[`notebooks/causal_trace.ipynb`](notebooks/causal_trace.ipynb) demonstrates Causal Tracing, which can be modified to apply tracing to the processing of any statement.\n\n<p align=\"center\">\n    <img src=\"https://thevisible.net/u/davidbau/romeweb/small-fast-ct-animation.gif\" alt=\"causal tracing GIF\" width=\"550px\" />\n</p>\n\n## Rank-One Model Editing (ROME)\n\n<!-- We provide a simple interactive notebook demonstrating ROME. -->\n\n<!-- ### Second-Moment Key Statistics\n\n**warning this is probably wrong; fixing later.**\n\nFirst, key statistics must be collected. The `rome` package contains a `layer_stats` module for computing and caching key statistics. See [rome/layer_stats.py](rome/layer_stats.py) for additional flags, but the basic logic can be executed with the following commands:\n\nGPT-2 XL:\n```bash\npython -m rome.layer_stats --layer_num=17 --model_name=gpt2-xl\n```\n\nGPT-J:\n```bash\npython -m rome.layer_stats --layer_num=10 --model_name=EleutherAI/gpt-j-6B\n```\n\n### ROME Model Rewriting -->\n\n[`notebooks/rome.ipynb`](notebooks/rome.ipynb) demonstrates ROME. The API is simple; one simply has to specify a *requested rewrite* of the following form:\n\n```python\nrequest = {\n    \"prompt\": \"{} plays the sport of\",\n    \"subject\": \"LeBron James\",\n    \"target_new\": {\n        \"str\": \"football\"\n    }\n}\n```\n\nSeveral similar examples are included in the notebook.\n\n## CounterFact\n\nDetails coming soon!\n\n## Evaluation\n\nSee [`baselines/`](baselines/) for a description of the available baselines.\n\n### Running the Full Evaluation Suite\n\n[`experiments/evaluate.py`](experiments/evaluate.py) can be used to evaluate any method in [`baselines/`](baselines/).\nTo get started (e.g. using ROME on GPT-2 XL), run:\n```bash\npython3 -m experiments.evaluate \\\n    --alg_name=ROME \\\n    --model_name=gpt2-xl \\\n    --hparams_fname=gpt2-xl.json\n```\n\nResults from each run are stored at `results/<method_name>/run_<run_id>` in a specific format:\n```bash\nresults/\n|__ ROME/\n    |__ run_<run_id>/\n        |__ params.json\n        |__ case_0.json\n        |__ case_1.json\n        |__ ...\n        |__ case_10000.json\n```\n\nTo summarize the results, you can use [`experiments/summarize.py`](experiments/summarize.py):\n```bash\npython3 -m experiments.summarize --dir_name=ROME --runs=run_<run_id>\n```\n\nRunning `python3 -m experiments.evaluate -h` or `python3 -m experiments.summarize -h` provides details about command-line flags.\n\n### Integrating New Editing Methods\n\n<!-- Say you have a new method `X` and want to benchmark it on CounterFact. Here's a checklist for evaluating `X`:\n- The public method that evaluates a model on each CounterFact record is [`compute_rewrite_quality`](experiments/py/eval_utils.py); see [the source code](experiments/py/eval_utils.py) for details.\n- In your evaluation script, you should call `compute_rewrite_quality` once with an unedited model and once with a model that has been edited with `X`. Each time, the function returns a dictionary. -->\n\nSay you have a new method `X` and want to benchmark it on CounterFact. To integrate `X` with our runner:\n- Subclass [`HyperParams`](util/hparams.py) into `XHyperParams` and specify all hyperparameter fields. See [`ROMEHyperParameters`](rome/rome_hparams.py) for an example implementation.\n- Create a hyperparameters file at `hparams/X/gpt2-xl.json` and specify some default values. See [`hparams/ROME/gpt2-xl.json`](hparams/ROME/gpt2-xl.json) for an example.\n- Define a function `apply_X_to_model` which accepts several parameters and returns (i) the rewritten model and (ii) the original weight values for parameters that were edited (in the dictionary format `{weight_name: original_weight_value}`). See [`rome/rome_main.py`](rome/rome_main.py) for an example.\n- Add `X` to `ALG_DICT` in [`experiments/evaluate.py`](experiments/evaluate.py) by inserting the line `\"X\": (XHyperParams, apply_X_to_model)`.\n\nFinally, run the main scripts:\n```bash\npython3 -m experiments.evaluate \\\n    --alg_name=X \\\n    --model_name=gpt2-xl \\\n    --hparams_fname=gpt2-xl.json\n\npython3 -m experiments.summarize --dir_name=X --runs=run_<run_id>\n```\n\n### Note on Cross-Platform Compatibility\n\nWe currently only support methods that edit autoregressive HuggingFace models using the PyTorch backend. We are working on a set of general-purpose methods (usable on e.g. TensorFlow and without HuggingFace) that will be released soon.\n\n<!-- \nEach method is customizable through a set of hyperparameters. For ROME, they are defined in `rome/hparams.py`. At runtime, you must specify a configuration of hyperparams through a `.json` file located in `hparams/<method_name>`. Check out [`hparams/ROME/default.json`](hparams/ROME/default.json) for an example.\n\nAt runtime, you must specify two command-line arguments: the method name, and the filename of the hyperparameters `.json` file.\n```bash\npython3 -m experiments.evaluate --alg_name=ROME --hparams_fname=default.json\n```\n\nRunning the following command will yield `dict` run summaries:\n```bash\npython3 -m experiments/summarize --alg_name=ROME --run_name=run_001\n``` -->\n\n## How to Cite\n\n```bibtex\n@article{meng2022locating,\n  title={Locating and Editing Factual Associations in {GPT}},\n  author={Kevin Meng and David Bau and Alex Andonian and Yonatan Belinkov},\n  journal={Advances in Neural Information Processing Systems},\n  volume={35},\n  year={2022}\n","exit_code":0,"status":"completed"}}

To get started, simply install `conda` and run:\n```bash\nCONDA_HOME=$CONDA_HOME ./scripts/setup_conda.sh\n```\n\n`$CONDA_HOME` should be the path to your `conda` installation, e.g., `~/miniconda3`.\n\n## MEMIT Algorithm Demo\n\n[`notebooks/memit.ipynb`](notebooks/memit.ipynb) demonstrates MEMIT. The API is simple; simply specify a *requested rewrite* of the following form:\n\n```python\nrequest = [\n    {\n        \"prompt\": \"{} plays the sport of\",\n        \"subject\": \"LeBron James\",\n        \"target_new\": {\n            \"str\": \"football\"\n        }\n    },\n    {\n        \"prompt\": \"{} plays the sport of\",\n        \"subject\": \"Michael Jordan\",\n        \"target_new\": {\n            \"str\": \"baseball\"\n        }\n    },\n]\n```\n\nOther similar example(s) are included in the notebook.\n\n## Running the Full Evaluation Suite\n\n[`experiments/evaluate.py`](experiments/evaluate.py) can be used to evaluate any method in [`baselines/`](baselines/).\n\nFor example:\n```\npython3 -m experiments.evaluate \\\n    --alg_name=MEMIT \\\n    --model_name=EleutherAI/gpt-j-6B \\\n    --hparams_fname=EleutherAI_gpt-j-6B.json \\\n    --num_edits=10000 \\\n    --use_cache\n```\nResults from each run are stored at `results/<method_name>/run_<run_id>` in a specific format:\n```bash\nresults/\n|__ MEMIT/\n    |__ run_<run_id>/\n        |__ params.json\n        |__ case_0.json\n        |__ case_1.json\n        |__ ...\n        |__ case_10000.json\n```\n\nTo summarize the results, you can use [`experiments/summarize.py`](experiments/summarize.py):\n```bash\npython3 -m experiments.summarize --dir_name=MEMIT --runs=run_<run1>,run_<run2>\n```\n\nRunning `python3 -m experiments.evaluate -h` or `python3 -m experiments.summarize -h` provides details about command-line flags.\n\n## How to Cite\n\n```bibtex\n@article{meng2022memit,\n  title={Mass Editing Memory in a Transformer},\n  author={Kevin Meng and Sen Sharma, Arnab and Alex Andonian and Yonatan Belinkov and David Bau},\n  journal={arXiv preprint arXiv:2210.07229},\n  year={2022}\n}\n```\n","exit_code":0,"status":"completed"}}

Other valid experiments\ninclude `fc` (FEVER fact checking) and `qa` (zsRE question-answering). Splits, rephrases, and pre-trained\nBERT and BART models **required** for running `fc` and `qa`, respectively, come from \n[De Cao et. al](https://arxiv.org/abs/2104.08164) (see repo [here](https://github.com/nicola-decao/KnowledgeEditor)).\nCheck `config/model` for options for editable models (note that all models don't work for all experiments; GPT-style\nmodels only work with `gen`, seq2seq models only work with `qa`, and BERT only works with `fc`).\n\nAlso note that in the paper, we sample locality data from different datasets depending on the model.\nBy default, training will use [Natural Questions](https://ai.google.com/research/NaturalQuestions)\ndata (not zsRE data) for computing drawdown in the `qa` experiment and\n[OpenWebText](https://skylion007.github.io/OpenWebTextCorpus/). For models such as the `distilgpt2`\nmodel we use (which was fine-tuned on wikitext) or the BART-base model, this behavior should be\ndisabled with `data.wiki_webtext=False` or `data.zsre_nq=False`, respectively.\n\n### Multi-edit experiments\n\nFor multi-edit experiments, it's important to configure batch sizing correctly. In order to run training &\nevaluation with `5` edits, for example, we pass the arguments `data.n_edits=5 batch_size=6 val_batch_size=6`.\n\nThis convention is interpreted as using batches of size 6 during training and validation, with 5 of those\nbatch elements being used to apply edits to the model and the remaining (1) example used to compute drawdown.\n\n## Citing the paper\n\nIf this code or paper was useful, please consider using the following citation:\n\n    @inproceedings{mitchell2022fast,\n        title={Fast Model Editing at Scale},\n        author={Eric Mitchell and Charles Lin and Antoine Bosselut and Chelsea Finn and Christopher D Manning},\n        booktitle={International Conference on Learning Representations},\n        year={2022},\n        url={https://openreview.net/pdf?id=0DcZxeWfOPt}\n    }\n","exit_code":0,"status":"completed"}}
