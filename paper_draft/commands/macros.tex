% USAGE EXAMPLES
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
%
% GOOD:
%   \newcommand{\hypogenic}{\textsc{HypoGeniC}\xspace}
%   Usage: "We propose \hypogenic to generate hypotheses."
%   Result: "We propose HypoGeniC to generate hypotheses."
%
% GOOD:
%   \newcommand{\ours}{{\bf HypoGeniC}\xspace}
%   Usage: "Our method, \ours, outperforms baselines."
%   Result: "Our method, HypoGeniC, outperforms baselines."
%
% BAD (no \xspace):
%   \newcommand{\hypogenic}{\textsc{HypoGeniC}}
%   Usage: "\hypogenic outperforms..."
%   Result: "HypoGeniCoutperforms..." (missing space!)
